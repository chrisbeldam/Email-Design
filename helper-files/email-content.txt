What’s in a name?  To reflect Ridgeway’s acquisition by Marshall Motor Holdings plc in May of this year, effective from the 1st of November, we have rebranded to Marshall.  Don’t worry – it’s not all change. Our excellent staff, standards and values will remain the same, ensuring that you receive consistently high levels of service.  The largest expansion acquisition that Marshall Motor Group has made to date, we are now part of a group that operates 103 franchise dealership businesses representing 24 different manufacturer brands across 25 counties in England, with a turnover in excess of £2.1bn per annum and 3,500 colleagues; but you, the customer, are still our Number One!  With Marshall Motor Group (who are the 7th largest UK motor group in the UK), we are in a better position than ever to exceed expectations and adopt 106 years of dedicated Marshall expertise, with customer care and impeccable industry knowledge at the heart of everything we do.  Just like always, we’re with you for the road ahead. Welcome to the next destination of our exciting journey.
As part of the rebrand ridgeway.co.uk will redirect to our new online home of marshall.co.ukfor all things Audi sales, service and parts!  Marshall. The new name for Audi in Oxford and Newbury.
